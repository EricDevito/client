We've had a onchain proposal [passed](https://houseoflilnouns.wtf/proposals/63) already through Lil Nouns to build https://houseoflilnouns.wtf/, and we'd love if Lil Nouns could take us on-chain to Nouns.     ### **Core vision and goals** Our vision is to make it easier for voters to participate in Nouns governance by providing rich context, intuitive conversation tools, and seamless integrations with other Nounish platforms. This will be built on top of an open framework, empowering developers and solving impactful problems specific to Nounish governance.

Use a TCR to curate new entries into the trait library.","Animated traits:  Introduce animated svgs as traits to expand the design space and expressivity of lil nouns without changing their low-pixel character. Also further increases the desirability since animations are dope.  Permissionless traits library via TCR:  Allows anyone to propose new traits to the trait list. This way, we can leverage the community‚Äôs creativity to introduce animated traits. To maintain the quality of the traits library, a TCR is introduced: new trait proposers must stake a number of lil nouns equivalent to how many it would take to submit a proposal. Any lil noun holder can challenge the proposal by staking an equivalent position. Lil nouns holders then vote to accept or decline the trait, with lil nounders having veto. The loser‚Äôs stake is then split between the winner and voters.  Why? 1. Make lil nouns more desirable to own (utility + aesthetics) 2. Leverage the community‚Äôs creativity 3. Reduces duplicate lil nouns over time (which is a greater problem for lils than bigs, due to issuance rate)","0xC3FdAdbAe46798CD8762185A09C5b672A7aA36Bb",-48,0,FALSE
