What you are not accounting for is the behaviour change that a mechanism like this would introduce. Meaning, if people know props go live Mondays, then that extra time will likely be taken to refine and put the prop on chain on the weekend. Conversely, this will actually speed up some props, given that they wont need to wait 2 full days to go live, if they submit before a deadline on Sunday.

212,"appreciate the feedback, I think the take on starting with smaller niche newsletters is an interesting take. I can see larger marketing initiative where we spread the message of Lil Nouns by sponsoring multiple smaller audience newsletters and podcasts. It's a great way to create some organic growth for the dao. With that said, numbers don't lie, we could exclude bankless with this proposal, still have the editorial interview where we are interviewed on the Green pill and drastically decrease overall costs. But 1.8 million DLs per month has a ton of potential value   The thing that's nice about this is it is a combined marketing outreach. We're getting the editorial interview which provides a deep dive into lil nouns dao while also shining a spotlight on the engaged community members. It gives dedicated members who are participating a platform to improve their social capital at the same time that we are promoting the community and pipeline of lilnounsdao.   The goal is to onboard new members into the community. Bankless is a trusted source of information in the the web3 world. New users often have a difficult time understanding which contracts or nft communities are legit and which are malicious. This marketing outreach effort helps to solidify our reputation by entering into the conversation with the bankless community as well as the gitcoin community which focuses on public goods and has a very large community of builders/devs. It will aso serve to open the door for dao-dao community relations.   My goal with the advertisement is to open with the activation of ""robonoun"" and then transition to shots where robonoun begins assembling the lil nouns logo with the help of other lil nouns then they present it to Nouns. The aim is to create excitement, drive interest in lilnounsdao as a quality content hub and promote interest in building while also promoting our pipeline to the world outside our direct community.  The verbal advertisement is created after we complete a sponsor onboarding form. Bankless has a sponsor onboarding Q/A which they then use to form the call to action and direct users toward our platform. I would keep the community engaged by being transparent when constructing these responses to their onboarding Q/A and together we can make sure that we maximize our potential for yielding a good result.
